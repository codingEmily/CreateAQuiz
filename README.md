PROJECT NAME: CreateAQuiz >> Should be Changed for accuracy
PROJECT GOALS: 3-4 pages: Main page/Sign-In, page for Creating a Test, page for viewing created tests, and a page for taking the test once you've selected one
Inital Step: Make it possible to create user input and save it to be accessed later
Step 2: Make TEST creation possible, aka connecting a bunch of QNA sets under one title
Step 3: Once it is possible to CREATE a series of QNA sets (data containing question, answer options, and correct answer) under one title and SAVE it, then make it so that after the tests are saved, you can't see which answer is correct
Step 4: Add interactivity- make saved tests "take-able", where a user can guess at which answer is correct (checking multiple choice options) and receive a final grade (letter and percentage) and view the "answer key"
Step 5: Create a main page or sign in, from which users can read about the project, access a menu- from which they can view saved tests, and the page where tests are created to choose what to do
Step 6: Make it possible to save a profile-name, and future users can see your name and the grade you got on a test
Step 7: Make multiple question-formats avaible- mult. choice, true/false, fill in the blank, etc. AND make quizlet style flash cards options (where user can see the answer by clicking a button, and does not receive a grade)
